## About

_**WORK IN PROGRESS**_

The main purpose of this plugin is to enable running kedro pipeline with Airflow on Kubernetes Cluster. In difference to 
[kedro-airflow](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-airflow) this plugin does not require additional libraries installed
in airflow runtime, it uses K8S infrastructure instead. 

The plugin can be used together with `kedro-docker` to simplify preparation of docker image for pipeline execution.
