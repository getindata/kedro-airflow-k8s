## About

The main purpose of this plugin is to enable running kedro pipeline with Airflow on Kubernetes Cluster. In difference to 
[kedro-airflow](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-airflow) this plugin does not require additional libraries installed
in airflow runtime, it uses K8S infrastructure instead. It supports translation
from Kedro pipeline DSL to [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/python-api-ref.html) (python API)
and generation of airflow [DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#dags).

The plugin can be used together with `kedro-docker` to simplify preparation of docker image for pipeline execution.
